Question 1:

Part 1:
Both average and best fitness remain relatively stable over many generations (from ~300 onwards), so the algorithm has likely found an optimal solution or reached a local optimum.
That is what it looked like visually after testing it up to 2000 generations.
From ~190 onwards up to ~230 the GA for both average and best fitness was consistently improving. However, later on, there was no improvements observable up to 2000 generations to its fair to assume it has plateaued.
So the best graph will stop at 250 generations
There are some peaks of best fitness and as such the average increases for that specific point but a general trend is not observable.
Running more generations beyond convergence doesnâ€™t provide meaningful improvements and just wastes resources.
Stopping when fitness stagnates ensures efficiency so its important to consider computational cost.

(spikes because sometimes they get lucky, a lot of cheese on the path of a mathematical curve they are following)

Part 2: Describe the behaviour of the mice as it evolves over evolutionary time.

Intially, the mice move in come kind of mathematical equation/curve way and are trying to collect cheese/yellow dots. However, they are just following a path and dont take into account the cheese/modify their pathing based on the nearest cheese. So they collect cheese only by chance.

As the generations progress, the mice get better at collecting cheese and the average fitness increases. This is because the mice are now actively looking for the cheese and trying to travel to the closest cheese relative to their position. There is now fierce competition between the mice to get to the cheese first, often many mice go for the same cheese because it is the closest to them.
The mice are now actively trying to get to the cheese and are not just moving randomly. They are now following a path to the cheese and are trying to get to the cheese, the speed of them is variable.

Part 3:
For both, why i am doing these experiments, whats my design, quantify the performance (graphs again) and decide if its worth it. what are the advantages and disadvantages of it? 
Put in the seeds and parameter values.
Keep seed the same 1. !!!


a) so for this modify sensor in evo mouse/combine th etwo/ experiment with parameters.



b) modify the neaural net, aka more layers, different initial values etc...




Question 2:
See the behaviour of the system after 10, 50 and 100 generations and base the answers on that? see how it changes.
