Question 1:

Part 1:
Both average and best fitness remain relatively stable over many generations (from ~300 onwards), so the algorithm has likely found an optimal solution or reached a local optimum.
That is what it looked like visually after testing it up to 2000 generations.
From ~190 onwards up to ~230 the GA for both average and best fitness was consistently improving. However, later on, there was no improvements observable up to 2000 generations to its fair to assume it has plateaued.
So the best graph will stop at 250 generations
There are some peaks of best fitness and as such the average increases for that specific point but a general trend is not observable.
Running more generations beyond convergence doesnâ€™t provide meaningful improvements and just wastes resources.
Stopping when fitness stagnates ensures efficiency so its important to consider computational cost.

Part 2: Describe the behaviour of the mice as it evolves over evolutionary time.
